I am a second year PhD student in Robotics at the [University of Michigan](https://robotics.umich.edu/). I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and am co-advised by [Dr. Dimitra Panagou](https://websites.umich.edu/~dpanagou/) in the [DASC Lab](https://dasc-lab.github.io/) and [Dr. Chris Vermillion](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/christopher-vermillion/) in the [CORE Lab](https://corelab.engin.umich.edu/). My research focuses on persistent planning and optimal control for renewably-powered robotic vehicles.

I was a [Park Scholar](https://park.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), where I received a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a B.S in Applied Mathematics. During my time at NCSU, I was involved with [Liquid Rocketry Lab](https://liquidrocketry.com) where I worked on developing the dynamic model and the guidance, navigation, and control aspects of a spaceshot liquid bipropellant rocket.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and guitar, playing and watching sports, and cooking.
